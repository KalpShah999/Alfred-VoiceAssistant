# Alfred-VoiceAssistant
My personal voice assistant, Alfred. 

Running the "Alfred.py" file should start everything.
 The files in the Setup folder are just words/phrases/commands that Alfred uses to break down your speech into useful information. 
 Those files will constantly be growing and more will added in the future. 

The "UpdateAlfred/py" file is used to create new commands within Alfred himself. 
 At the moment, this self writing feature is very limited and will be worked on in the future. 
 
If the voice assistant is not running for you correctly, it could be because you may not have a lot of the packages that are required downloaded on your computer. 
 You can check the packages that you will need by just reviewing the imports that are being made on the "Alfred.py" file 
 
The AIML file is there to provide Alfred some human like speech. The AIML files include phrases that Alfred would respond back with for instances where a command is not provided, but an interaction with Alfred is requested. 
 This gives him a good chat bot like personaliltiy that I hope to expand in the future as well.
